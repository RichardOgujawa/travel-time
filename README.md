# Coding Practice

#### The main purpose for turning this mock-up into code was to practise animating in code using things like: Pseudo-elements, hover animations, DOM manipulation, etc. <a href="https://github.com/RichardOgujawa/kitchen">Kitchen.co</a> 

I took the header part of this mock-up and turned it into functional code: <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/121586571/Travel-time">Time Travel</a> by <a href="https://www.behance.net/priale232f443">Alexsandr Prytkov</a>
