# Coding Practice

#### The main purpose for turning this mock-up into code was to practise animating in code using things like: Pseudo-elements, hover animations, DOM manipulation, etc. As such I didn't spend much time making the site responsive unlike my previous re-coding project <a href="https://github.com/RichardOgujawa/kitchen">Kitchen.co</a> 

I took the header part of this mock-up and turned it into functional code: <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/121586571/Travel-time">Time Travel</a> by <a href="https://www.behance.net/priale232f443">Alexsandr Prytkov</a>

## What I learrned
- You can't grab pseudo-elements because they're not real DOM elements. 
- How to do gradients: 'background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #000, transparent);'

## Skills used
- HTML
- CSS 
- JavaScript
